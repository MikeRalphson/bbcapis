      description: Fetch metadata about Programmes (brands, series, episodes, clips).
        By applying different filter restrictions this feed can be used in many
        ways, for example to retrieve all series belonging to a brand, all the
        episodes and/or clips for a specific series, or any TLEO objects for a
        masterbrand. Other filters permit restricting to specific formats and/or
        genres, and you can request specific versions (for example Signed or
        Audio-Described). Parameters may be combined in any way suitable for
        your application.
